2-int_index.c
write function hat searches for intergers and write prototypes aftrerwards.
size is the number of elements in the array and cmp is the pointer to the function.
int_index returns the index of the first element for which the cmp function does not return 0

If no element matches, return -1

If size <= 0, return -1

3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h
Use standard library
num1 and num2 usage of integers
operator is one of the following:

+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
